# Maze-Game

Save the world from Cersei Lannister (in a maze game setup).
Story: Melisandre, also known as red woman, was born in the city of Melony (this city lies in the centre of the maze world), and is known to have supernatural powers. She has been known to be lived for 2000 years and used her sorcery to save the world from evil lannisters. It has been recently known that her immortality comes from the pendant she wears and few wise men say that the owner can only live for a few seconds without the magical pendant.
But on a very dark day, evil Cersei Lannister stole her pendant and hidden herself into an unknown city of labyrinths. Now it’s our time to save the world and find Cersei as soon as possible and return the pendant to Melisandre and return balance to the world. Thanks to AI this could be done in a very fast and efficient manner. Agent Jon Snow (the AI master) is put up to the task of finding the pendant. Thanks to agent Snow we came to know the location of where cercei is hiding and we also have the maze world map. But it will take ages for a person to reach there but with agent snow’s AI mastership this could be done in mere seconds.

The maze world is generated from empty grid and then adding walls of random length to random locations.

The goal is to find a path from corner to corner. Possible moves are Up, Down, Left or Right. Distance or length is measured with manhattan distance which is the sum of vertical and horizontal lengths.

Algorithms to compare to find a path :

BFS: breadth first search
DFS: depth first search 
UCS: Uniform-Cost Search 
IDS: Iterative Deepning Search 
A* (A-star) heuristic Search
